## Design Decisions and Enhancements

### Design Decisions

1. **Simplicity**: The form is built using plain HTML, CSS, and TypeScript to keep it simple and lightweight.
2. **Validation**: Basic validation is implemented to ensure required fields are filled out.
3. **Navigation**: Users can navigate between steps using Back and Next buttons.
4. **Data Persistence**: `localStorage` is used to persist data between steps and page reloads.
5. **Responsiveness**: The form is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring usability on various devices.

### Enhancements for Production-Grade Application

1. **State Management**: Integrate a state management library like Redux or Context API to manage form state more efficiently.
2. **Form Libraries**: Use form libraries like Formik or React Hook Form for better form handling and validation.
3. **Styling**: Implement a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components or Emotion for more scalable and maintainable styling.
4. **API Integration**: Connect the form to a backend API to submit the collected data and handle responses.
5. **Error Handling**: Improve error handling to provide better feedback to users.
6. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests using testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to ensure the form works as expected.
7. **Accessibility**: Enhance accessibility by following ARIA guidelines and ensuring the form is usable by screen readers.
8. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize performance by lazy loading components and minimizing re-renders.
9. **Security**: Implement security measures like input sanitization and validation to prevent XSS attacks and ensur
